***SeqFinder 4.0.1 16/06/2022***
Specification of virulence database --> "VIR" is now an option that can be provided in the arguments file that is provided to SeqFinder.
Update of virulence database --> 1531 duplicated genes removed and genes from DTU virulence database integrated
Virulence dictionary created --> Gene function (where known) is provided as an additional column in the output. Another column with pathotypes that the gene is also identified in is also provided (where known)
Extra columns removed --> Additonal columns "antimicrobial" and "class" are only provided in the output if the user specifies the "AMR" database
***SeqFinder 4.0.2 23/06/2022***
Specification of disinfectant database --> "DIS" is now an option that can be provided in the arguments file that is provided to SeqFinder.
Creation of disinfectant database (16 genes) using information from DTU
Disinfectant dictionary created --> Class, Phenotype and function are provided as an additional columns in the output.
The reference database and dictionary used in the creation of the results are also added as additional columns
***SeqFinder 4.0.2 (minor update) 07/09/2022***
New folder structure for the results --> Results are now placed inside a folder with the same name as the database provided to SeqFinder to check against. Within this folder, another folder with the date SeqFinder was run is also created.
Checks python modules are installed --> Seqfinder will check that the relevant python modules are installed before continuing. Otherwise will direct user how to install the modules.
***SeqFinder 4.0.3 23/03/2023***
Change of trimming tool to fastp --> This provides a major speed increase from ~6 mins to ~1.5 mins per sample for the quality control
More informative error messages --> SeqFinder will now provide more informative error messages if there are no hits in your sample or the MLST mapping failed.
No more early finishes --> SeqFinder will continue to work through the samples and add in the error message to the output for the user to see. This primarily works for the AMR database but will be rolled out to the others soon.
***SeqFinder 4.0.3 (minor update) 28/04/2023***
Updated the good_snps_filtering.py script --> Detect mutations in position 247 for gyrA, originally it only looked for mutations in position 248 (S83A mutation).
***SeqFinder 4.0.4 10/05/2023***
Replacement of disinfectant database --> Disinfectant database has been combined with a metal and biocide database (BAM)
Biocide and metal dictionary --> Metal/biocide function, Genomic location, Gene origin and Class information inserted into the output to provide more context to the gene hits
***SeqFinder 4.0.5 24/05/2023**
Automatic filtering by abricate --> For a subset of gene families ("TEM", "SHV", "CTX", "OXA", "CMY","tet","aadA") the script will check to see if a hit has been found in abricate and subsequently filter the seqfinder output to only contain the concordant result. If there is no result in abricate the seqfinder result will be left as is.
Deletion of additional genes --> For some genes (CMY-2, SHV-12) additional hits were also reported by SeqFinder such as BIL-1, LAT-1, LEN-6. Now these hits will only be reported if those genes have a perfect match of 100% mapped and 0 SNPs if CMY-2 or SHV-12 is present in the same isolate.
Multiple hits within same gene family --> Where abricate identifies multiple hits within the same family but of these hits has been discarded by good_snps_filtering.py, it will now insert that second hit into the output and populate it with information from the original seqfinder output.
AMR database updated --> Duplicate genes have been removed. >550 new genes have been added. Some gene nomenclature has been updated to reflect that in the literature and other databases. Duplicate plasmid sequences also removed.
Versioning --> Versions of SeqFinder, abricate, unicycler and spades are now provided in output as new columns for quality purposes. The unicycler and spades versions will only be included if the corresponding AMR_unicycler.py script was used to assemble your isolates.
Versioning --> Seqfinder version now provided in output as new column for quality purposes
***SeqFinder 4.0.5 (minor update) 14/06/2023***
Inclusion of chromosomal genes in abricate --> Details from abricate about gyrA, parC and ampC will be included in the final output if present
Versioning mk II --> The MLST file the user normalised their samples against is included in the final output
***SeqFinder 4.0.6 03/10/2023***
Processing of isolates --> The way the pipeline processes isolates provided to it has been altered. This is to avoid undesirable behaviour caused by fully sensitive isolates that used to result in the skipping of isolates.
File checking --> If the user provides multiple files with the same name the pipeline will ask you which of these files you wish to keep and will ignore the duplicate(s).
Reference checking --> Further reference file checking for empty lines or headers that do not start with an alphanumeric character to avoid undesirable behaviour.
Joining of partial abricate hits --> If gene hits are split across multiple contigs in abricate the pipeline will now join these hits together if the total range of the combined fragments exceed 90% of the gene length. 
Abricate filtering threshold reduced --> The filtering threshold for hits from abricate to be compared with those from SeqFinder has been reduced from 90% to 80%.
Plasmid mismatches --> If there is a mismatch between the plasmid genes called by SeqFinder and abricate (for example SeqFinder calls PlasR-p0097_IncX1 and abricate calls PlasR-p0096_IncX1) that information is now added. This is ONLY for plasmids, NOT AMR genes.
User warnings --> Warnings given to the user in the first column if any of the following are found: Percentage mapped in SeqFinder <95%, Normalised depth is under 0.4, Gene has been split across multiple contigs, mismatch between SeqFinder and abricate gene calls, Abricate result is blank, Abricate % coverage <90, Abricate % identity <90
Additional filtering for non-AMR databases --> Filtering the non-AMR databases by the same percentage mapped and number of snps threshold as used for the AMR database now turned this on
Column ordering --> Minor changes to column ordering and removing unrelated columns from non-AMR databases
pubmlst schemes --> SeqFinder compatible MLST schemes for every scheme found in pubmlst can now be found here: APHASeqFinder_4.0.6/references/mlst/pubmlst_schemes
