***SeqFinder 4.0.1 16/06/2022***
Specification of virulence database --> "VIR" is now an option that can be provided in the arguments file that is provided to SeqFinder.
Update of virulence database --> 1531 duplicated genes removed and genes from DTU virulence database integrated
Virulence dictionary created --> Gene function (where known) is provided as an additional column in the output. Another column with pathotypes that the gene is also identified in is also provided (where known)
Extra columns removed --> Additonal columns "antimicrobial" and "class" are only provided in the output if the user specifies the "AMR" database
***SeqFinder 4.0.2 23/06/2022***
Specification of disinfectant database --> "DIS" is now an option that can be provided in the arguments file that is provided to SeqFinder.
Creation of disinfectant database (16 genes) using information from DTU
Disinfectant dictionary created --> Class, Phenotype and function are provided as an additional columns in the output.
The reference database and dictionary used in the creation of the results are also added as additional columns
***SeqFinder 4.0.2 (minor update) 07/09/2022***
New folder structure for the results --> Results are now placed inside a folder with the same name as the database provided to SeqFinder to check against. Within this folder, another folder with the date SeqFinder was run is also created.
Checks python modules are installed --> Seqfinder will check that the relevant python modules are installed before continuing. Otherwise will direct user how to install the modules.
***SeqFinder 4.0.3 23/03/2023***
Change of trimming tool to fastp --> This provides a major speed increase from ~6 mins to ~1.5 mins per sample for the quality control
More informative error messages --> SeqFinder will now provide more informative error messages if there are no hits in your sample or the MLST mapping failed.
No more early finishes --> SeqFinder will continue to work through the samples and add in the error message to the output for the user to see. This primarily works for the AMR database but will be rolled out to the others soon.
***SeqFinder 4.0.3 (minor update) 28/04/2023***
Updated the good_snps_filtering.py script --> Detect mutations in position 247 for gyrA, originally it only looked for mutations in position 248 (S83A mutation).
***SeqFinder 4.0.4 10/05/2023***
Replacement of disinfectant database --> Disinfectant database has been combined with a metal and biocide database (BAM)
Biocide and metal dictionary --> Metal/biocide function, Genomic location, Gene origin and Class information inserted into the output to provide more context to the gene hits
***SeqFinder 4.0.5 24/05/2023**
Automatic filtering by abricate --> For a subset of gene families ("TEM", "SHV", "CTX", "OXA", "CMY","tet","aadA") the script will check to see if a hit has been found in abricate and subsequently filter the seqfinder output to only contain the concordant result. If there is no result in abricate the seqfinder result will be left as is.
Deletion of additional genes --> For some genes (CMY-2, SHV-12) additional hits were also reported by SeqFinder such as BIL-1, LAT-1, LEN-6. Now these hits will only be reported if those genes have a perfect match of 100% mapped and 0 SNPs if CMY-2 or SHV-12 is present in the same isolate.
Multiple hits within same gene family --> Where abricate identifies multiple hits within the same family but of these hits has been discarded by good_snps_filtering.py, it will now insert that second hit into the output and populate it with information from the original seqfinder output.
AMR database updated --> Duplicate genes have been removed. >550 new genes have been added. Some gene nomenclature has been updated to reflect that in the literature and other databases. Duplicate plasmid sequences also removed.
Versioning --> Versions of SeqFinder, abricate, unicycler and spades are now provided in output as new columns for quality purposes. The unicycler and spades versions will only be included if the corresponding AMR_unicycler.py script was used to assemble your isolates.
