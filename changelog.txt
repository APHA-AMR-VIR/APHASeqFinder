***SeqFinder 4.0.1 16/06/2022***
Specification of virulence database --> "VIR" is now an option that can be provided in the arguments file that is provided to SeqFinder.
Update of virulence database --> 1531 duplicated genes removed and genes from DTU virulence database integrated
Virulence dictionary created --> Gene function (where known) is provided as an additional column in the output. Another column with pathotypes that the gene is also identified in is also provided (where known)
Extra columns removed --> Additonal columns "antimicrobial" and "class" are only provided in the output if the user specifies the "AMR" database
***SeqFinder 4.0.2 23/06/2022***
Specification of disinfectant database --> "DIS" is now an option that can be provided in the arguments file that is provided to SeqFinder.
Creation of disinfectant database (16 genes) using information from DTU
Disinfectant dictionary created --> Class, Phenotype and function are provided as an additional columns in the output.
The reference database and dictionary used in the creation of the results are also added as additional columns
***SeqFinder 4.0.2 (minor update) 07/09/2022***
New folder structure for the results --> Results are now placed inside a folder with the same name as the database provided to SeqFinder to check against. Within this folder, another folder with the date SeqFinder was run is also created.
Checks python modules are installed --> Seqfinder will check that the relevant python modules are installed before continuing. Otherwise will direct user how to install the modules.
***SeqFinder 4.0.3 23/03/2023***
Change of trimming tool to fastp --> This provides a major speed increase from ~6 mins to ~1.5 mins per sample for the quality control
More informative error messages --> SeqFinder will now provide more informative error messages if there are no hits in your sample or the MLST mapping failed.
No more early finishes --> SeqFinder will continue to work through the samples and add in the error message to the output for the user to see. This primarily works for the AMR database but will be rolled out to the others soon.
